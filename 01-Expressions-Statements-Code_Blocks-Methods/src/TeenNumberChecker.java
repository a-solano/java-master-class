/**
 * We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).

Write a method named hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if one of the parameters is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.


EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* hasTeen(9, 99, 19);  should return true since 19 is in range 13 - 19

* hasTeen(23, 15, 42);  should return true since 15 is in range 13 - 19

* hasTeen(22, 23, 34);  should return false since numbers 22, 23, 34 are not in range 13-19


Write another method named isTeen with 1 parameter of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the parameter is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.

EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* isTeen(9);  should return false since 9 is in not range 13 - 19

* isTeen(13);  should return true since 13 is in range 13 - 19

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.
